# Download the file 5.R.RData and load it into R using load("5.R.RData").
# Consider the linear regression model of y on X1 and X2. What is the standard error for B1?

load("5.R.RData")

model1 <- lm(y ~ X1 + X2)
summary(model1)

# answeer is B1 = 0.026

# Q2 Next, plot the data using matplot(Xy,type="l").
# Which of the following do you think is most likely given what you see?
# B1 is too high
# B1 is too low
# B1 is about right

matplot(Xy,type="l",col = c(2:5,7))
legend("bottomleft",pch = 15:18, legend = colnames(Xy), col = c(2:5,7))

# answeer B1 is to low

#There is very strong autocorrelation between consecutive rows of the data matrix.
# Roughly speaking, we have about 10-20 repeats of every data point,
# so the sample size is in effect much smaller than the number of rows (1000 in this case).



# Now, use the (standard) bootstrap to estimate B1. To within 10%, what do you get?
